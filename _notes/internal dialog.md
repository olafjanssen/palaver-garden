title: Internal dialogue

#idea

What separates us from a machine during and between conversations is an internal dialogue. This internal conversation continues even when the user is not around. It may:

- play back old conversations
- pose reflective questions about these situations
- imagine alternative conversations
- imagine follow-up conversations

These can then be used to form a prompt for when a user starts talking again to the nlp agent.
